// Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
// If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
// The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

// name + " plays banjo" 
// name + " does not play banjo"

// Names given are always valid strings.

//Solution:
let areYouPlayingBanjo = (name) => name[0] === 'r' || name[0] === 'R' ? `${name} plays banjo` : `${name} does not play banjo`


// There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

// findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
// findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55

const findUniq = (arr) => arr.find(v => arr.indexOf(v) === arr.lastIndexOf(v))
